                creating experiences that are visually compelling and functional.Joining Altschool was a tough decision
                i had to make on myself but here are a few reasons why i joined.
            <ul class="myList">
                <li><b>Focused Learning Path</b> Altschool offers a well-structured curriculum specifically designed for

                    stay current with industry trends.</li>
                <li><b>Hands-On Projects</b> The Altschool Frontend Engineering track emphasizes practical,
                    project-based learning. This means you'll work on real-world projects that help you apply what

            <p>"Coding is something i realised i had ran away from all my life,not because i didn't know or understand
                it, i just was scared of it. I've been lookign at Ui jobs around and many of them require you to have
                basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Alast, my fears have come knocking on my door. What else to
                do but to face it. I'm going to work hard to gather all possible foundational knowlegde i can from
                altschool as i begin this Journey." </p>
